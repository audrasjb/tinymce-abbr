Provides abbreviation button for WordPress TinyMCE visual editor.

== Description ==

This plugin should be used to supply abbreviation support in the TinyMCE visual editor. Once activated, it provides an "ABR" button which allows editor to indicate the meaning of each abbreviation used in Pages, Posts or any custom post types used in your WordPress installation. The markup is fully compatible with accessibility rules like Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). It uses `<abbr>…</abbr>` HTML markup instead of the deprecated `<acronym>…</acronym>` HTML markup.

**Available languages**
* English
* French

English:

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use it in your WordPress visual editor with the "ABR" button

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why I cannot see any changes on my website front-end? =
Your theme probably don't provides any styles for the ABBR tag… You can check if your ABBR tag is generated by "hovering" your ABBR expression with the mouse. Wait 1 second: a tooltip is supposed to appear. If you want some styles, you can put the following CSS in your theme (or wait for the next version of this plugin).
`abbr{border-bottom:1px dotted black;cursor:help;}`

= What about adding language attribute? =
If the abbreviation's language is different from your page main language, you have to indicate the language of your abbreviation to be fully compatible with accessibility rules.

== Screenshots ==

1. the 'ABR' button in your TinyMCE visual editor (second line of buttons).
